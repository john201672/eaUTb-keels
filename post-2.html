                        <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex might currently be on a break from royal duties, but a previously unseen photo of them with Adele has emerged on social media. It was reported that the royal couple and the singer had visited the Hubb Community Kitchen together last December and now @mykitchenwonders_faiza has shared that moment on Instagram.</p>
                        <p><img src="img/p2.1.png"></p>
                        <p>The sweet snap shows the couple surrounded by women from the group, whose community was affected by the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017. Prince Harry is smiling at the camera while Meghan and Adele, at the top of the frame, are both mid-laugh. Faiza captioned the photo: "Very beautiful memories, with the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Adele the singer. So proud to be part of the Community Cook Book TOGETHER."	</p>
                        <p>For her first solo project last year, Meghan supported the Hubb Community Kitchen by composing the foreword for their cookbook Together. Harry and the Duchess' mother Doria Ragland joined Meghan for the launch of the book at Kensington Palace in September 2018, where they helped to prepare food for guests.</p>
                        <p>Adele has also made several visits to the kitchen and has shown her support for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire. The singer was also among the celebrities who congratulated Harry and Meghan on the day of their wedding in May 2018, posting a selfie with a glass of champagne on Instagram, with the caption: "Congratulations Meghan and Harry. You’re the most beautiful bride. I can’t stop thinking of how happy Princess Diana is upstairs x".</p>
                        <p><img src="img/p2.2.jpg"><p>Meghan visiting the Hubb Community Kitchen in December 2018</p></p>
                        <p>On Thursday, the Duchess posted a series of throwback photos on Sussex Royal's Instagram from her visit to the kitchen in December 2018, when she was pregnant with baby Archie. In the caption Meghan wrote: "Thank you, ladies, for the leadership and inspiration that your cooking and love of community brings to all those around you. We remain so very proud of the good work that you continue to do, and cannot wait to see what 2020 brings!"</p>
                        <p>Adele has been making headlines following her impressive weight loss, after photos were published of the star looking noticeably slimmer while on holiday in the Caribbean over the Christmas period. The Hello singer is said to have shed seven stone after transforming her lifestyle, and her former personal trainer has given an insight into how she lost the pounds. Chatting on Lorraine, Camila Goodis revealed that she has cut her calorie intake down to 1,000 calories a day, as well as sticking to daily workouts. "She's working out but I think 90 per cent of it is diet," she told host Lorraine Kelly. "It's a good diet to shed the weight. The first week is intense, green juices and only 1,000 calories. She doesn't look too thin – she looks amazing."</p>
                        <p><img src="img/p2.3.jpg"><p>Adele has lost seven stone after transforming her lifestyle</p></p>
                        <p>Camila – a Pilates trainer – has trained Adele alongside Robbie Williams' wife Ayda Field. On working with the star, she added: "When she came for a work out I didn't know it was her and when she left I thought : 'Oh it looks a little bit like Adele. She looks amazing – she's changed her lifestyle and diet." The star is said to have been working out with US trainer Dalton Wong over the past few months to help with her weight loss. Dalton has trained the likes of Jennifer Lawrence.</p>
                        <p><img src="img/p2.4.jpg"><p>The Hello singer kickstarted her diet by cutting down to just 1,000 calories at the beginning</p></p>
                        <p>After the star shared a photo of her slimmed-down figure on Instagram, she was inundated with messages from her fans, with one fan writing: "CONGRATULATIONS on your healthy weight/size!" while another follower told her, "Girl u look great." One fan said: "Adele looked hot anyway, now look at her!!!" Her weight loss following after her separation from husband Simon Konecki, following three years of marriage. The pair began dating in 2011, and welcomed their son Angelo, now seven, the following year.</p>
                        <p>Back in 2017, the Someone Like You singer hit back at online trolls who compared her Grammy's look to Princess Fiona from Shrek. Adele told her audience in Perth, Australia: "I wore this dress, right, everyone said I looked like Fiona. I don't [expletive] care. It was Givenchy couture! They can say what they want." According to Metro, she also remarked: "I worked out. Obviously I'm a large lady and I like eating food very much, but I was working out twice a day to fit into that Givenchy dress because it was quite tight."</p>
